# [Tiny-Prolog-in-OCaml-OneFile](https://github.com/Naereen/Tiny-Prolog-in-OCaml-OneFile) :tada: **running on a Numworks calculator**
> A tiny implementation of a small subset of the Prolog language, in OCaml. With small and fun examples.
>
> WARNING: this project only has an **educational purpose**, for a real-world use of Prolog, please refer to [GNU Prolog (gprolog)](http://gprolog.org/).

This folder contains [the code](prolog.ml), embeds one of the [examples](https://github.com/Naereen/Tiny-Prolog-in-OCaml-OneFile/tree/master/examples) I wrote in 2018/2020, for a tiny [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) implementation, written in [the OCaml language](https://ocaml.org/).

To build the project, it should be really easy: clone, run `make`, relax and enjoy :tada:. The implementation focuses on a very small subset of Prolog, see the examples for a good idea of what is supported.

## How to build the NWA Numworks app

First, you should `git clone` the [main project](https://github.com/Naereen/OMicroB/tree/numworks/) (my fork of `OMicroB`, branch `numworks`), having ran `make clean ; ./configure -target numworks ; make` to configure and compile `omicrob` for the Numworks...

Then, you can run, from this folder:
```bash
$ make
```
This should create the `prolog.nwa` app, which you can then [install on your Numworks calculator](https://my.numworks.com/apps).

## It now supports user defined theory/questions
> By default, the app runs the example below of Tom & Jerry, but you can define two files `prolog_theory.py` for the theory, and `prolog_questions.py` for the questions.

See my two files on [my user space on Numworks.com](https://my.numworks.com/python/lilian-besson-1/):

- Defining the "Tom & Jerry" theory: <https://my.numworks.com/python/lilian-besson-1/prolog_theory>
- three questions to ask to this "Tom & Jerry" theory: <https://my.numworks.com/python/lilian-besson-1/prolog_questions>

# **Old documentation**

## Example of use of the `prolog` binary
- A theory has this form, first with axioms (predicate):
```prolog
cat(tom).
mouse(jerry).
```
- Then maybe some rules, stating that [a mouse is fast and a cat can be stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry):
```prolog
fast(X) <-- mouse(X).
stupid(X) <-- cat(X).
```

- If you save this file (see [this example](examples/tomandjerry.pl)), you can then load it with the `prolog` binary:

```bash
$ ./prolog/prolog ./examples/tomandjerry.pl
?- stupid(tom).
  { }
continue ? (o/n) [o] :
```

- This `{ }` is an empty model, meaning that `stupid(tom).` evaluates to True in an empty model (no need for instanciation).

- You can also ask your question directly in the command line:
```bash
$ ./prolog/prolog ./examples/tomandjerry.pl "fast(tom)."
?- fast(tom).
```
- An empty response mean that the term is false, no matter the model.

- You can add more rules, as you want.
```prolog
ishuntedby(X, Y) <-- mouse(X), cat(Y).
```
```bash
$ ./prolog/prolog ./examples/tomandjerry.pl "ishuntedby(tom, jerry)."
?- ishuntedby(tom, jerry).
$ ./prolog/prolog ./examples/tomandjerry.pl "ishuntedby(jerry, tom)."
?- ishuntedby(jerry, tom).
  { }
```

- You can also add comments, that are lines starting with one or more `#` character.
```prolog
# the mouse always espace the cat!
istrickedby(X, Y) <-- cat(X), mouse(Y).
```

## More examples ?
