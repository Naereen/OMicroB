# [ViRoLam/Mini-Caml-Interpreter](https://github.com/ViRoLam/Mini-Caml-Interpreter) :tada: **running on a Numworks calculator**
> A tiny implementation of a small subset of a programming language like OCaml, written in OCaml. With small and fun examples.

## How to build the NWA Numworks app

First, you should `git clone` the [main project](https://github.com/Naereen/OMicroB/tree/numworks/) (my fork of `OMicroB`, branch `numworks`), having ran `make clean ; ./configure -target numworks ; make` to configure and compile `omicrob` for the Numworks...

Then, you can run, from this folder:
```bash
$ make
```
This should create the `minicaml.nwa` app, which you can then [install on your Numworks calculator](https://my.numworks.com/apps).

## TODO: support user defined programs
> TODO: By default, the app runs a short example, but you can define a file `minicaml.py` for the code of the program to be executed.

See the files on [my user-space on Numworks.com](https://my.numworks.com/python/lilian-besson-1/):
